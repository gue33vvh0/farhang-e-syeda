  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>
  <strong>Why should you use this website at all?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
  The maintainers and owners of this website are Urdu-speaking Pakistanis. Urdu is ingrained in us, and we refuse to let it dwindle, be corrupted, or die.
  </p>

  <p>
  Unfortunately, in the internet age, Urdu is sidelined in favor of English, which is undoubtedly the de facto language of the web, as it has been adopted at the lowest and highest levels of computing. This is a small step to ensure the spirit of Urdu remains alive and well on the Internet forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Why should you use this website over Rekhta or other online Urdu dictionaries?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
  Rekhta does not provide Urdu words and definitions as colloquially spoken in the Pakistani vernacular. Rekhta was founded by an Indian gentleman who has, "a deep love for the Urdu language." Translations and (less commonly) spelling are often incorrect on Rekhta. Farhang-e-Syeda aims to be the most complete & accurate Pakistani Urdu dictionary on the Internet.
  </p>

  <p>
  All other online dictionaries have many issues, including but not limited to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Not indexed - paper copy dictionaries only digitized, not searchable</li>
    <li>Incomplete or inaccurate</li>
    <li>Riddled with ads</li>
    <li>Unusable or unmaintained</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Why is there a distinction between Pakistani Urdu and Urdu?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
  While Urdu spans multiple countries, the distinction of Pakistani Urdu is important. This is mainly because Urdu is the national language of Pakistan. Therefore, after 1947, Pakistan now owns the language of Urdu and is the sole authority and maintainer of the language.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Are there any other legitimate authorities on Pakistani Urdu?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
  The Urdu Dictionary Board was created and maintained by the government of Pakistan. They have a website that is now defunct: <a href="http://udb.gov.pk">udb.gov.pk</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  You will note a lot of the words on Farhang-e-Syeda were sourced from UDB. Unfortunately, in 2017, UDB was defunded due to political issues. Farhang-e-Syeda aims to pick up and carry forward UDB's mission with the goal of indefinite access and updates to the dictionary. We will never be defunded; we merely run on your support and donations. As long as there are Urdu speakers in this world, Farhang-e-Syeda will serve their needs.
  </p>

  <p>
  In our effort to be the most complete and accurate Urdu dictionary, we also source from historically relevant dictionaries for etymological reasons, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Farhang-e-Asifyya</li>
    <li>Feroz Lugat</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  For colloquial consistency, we also source words from users like you.
